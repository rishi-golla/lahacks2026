## OmegaClaw Quick Start Guide

## About OmegaClaw

OmegaClaw is a persistent AI agent written in MeTTa — SingularityNET's AGI programming language — running on the OpenCog Hyperon platform. Its entire control loop is approximately 200 lines of MeTTa, fully inspectable and modifiable. Unlike agent frameworks built around LLMs with retrieval bolted on, OmegaClaw uses the LLM for generation while delegating memory and reasoning to dedicated symbolic systems — AtomSpace and PLN — designed for that purpose from the ground up.

---

## What OmegaClaw Does

- Runs a token-efficient agentic loop that receives messages, selects skills, and acts.
- Maintains a three-tier memory architecture (working, long-term, AtomSpace).
- Delegates reasoning to one of two formal engines, orchestrated by the LLM:
  - **NAL** — Non-Axiomatic Logic, symbolic inference under uncertainty.
  - **PLN** — Probabilistic Logic Networks, probabilistic higher-order reasoning.
- Exposes an extensible skill system covering memory, shell and file I/O, communication channels, web search, remote agents, and formal reasoning.

> **Note:** OmegaClaw is an autonomous AI agent designed to independently set goals, make decisions, and take actions (including actions that the user did not specifically request or anticipate). Its behavior is influenced by large language models provided by third parties, the outputs of which are inherently non-deterministic. OmegaClaw may also be susceptible to prompt injection and other adversarial manipulation techniques. The user is strongly advised to run OmegaClaw in an isolated environment with the minimum permissions necessary for the intended use case. See the full Disclaimer below.

## Option 1: Docker Quickstart (Recommended)

*Easiest install — up and running with a working agent quickly.*

### Requirements

- Docker
- Python
- Linux/Mac terminal
- API Key
- Communication Channel - 2 options:
  - IRC (lightweight interface on IRC protocol server); to use, create a unique  Private Channel name for webchat.quakenet.org. Private Channel names start with ## and should be unique like  ##omega12345
  - Telegram (modern social chat application); to use, search /botfather on Telegram, enter /newbot to create a new bot token, and follow directions to name and join your bot’s private channel.

> **Note:** the IRC channel name you choose should be unique, to decrease the odds other individuals will join it; if someone enters your channel, and your bot is unattended, they will have full access to the bot and whatever permissions it has on your docker/ machine - stop the omegaclaw docker when not in use, and always monitor the channel.

### Steps

**1. Run the launch script:**

```shell
docker pull singularitynet/omegaclaw:hackathon2604
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asi-alliance/OmegaClaw-Core/refs/tags/hackathon2604/scripts/omegaclaw | bash -s -- singularitynet/omegaclaw:hackathon2604
```

**2. Proceed through the start-up script:  
   1) Read the disclaimer \- understand the risks of running an agent and take appropriate precautions; to proceed, type ‘accept’  
   2) Choose 1\) IRC or 2\) Telegram  
      1) For IRC, enter your unique private channel ID  
      2) For Telegram enter your bot token  
   3) Select desired LLM to use  
   4) Enter your API key

**3. Join your preferred channel:**

   1) IRC: navigate to website [https://webchat.quakenet.org](https://webchat.quakenet.org/), enter a username for yourself and your exact channel name as during setup (e.g., \#\#omega12345).   
   2) Telegram: navigate to your DM with your bot (e.g. https://t.me/\<botname\>  
   3) Wait for your agent to download, initialize its processes, and join the chat.

**4. Interact with OmegaClaw:**

Try these prompts to get started:

- `"Search the web for recent latest trends in quantum computing and summarize what you find. Remember this — I'll ask you about it later."` — tests web search, memory storage, and multi-turn recall
- `"What skills do you have available? Which ones have you used in our conversation so far?"` — exercises self-inspection and AtomSpace query
- `"I want to build a live crypto price alert system. Break this into steps, and tell me your plan."` — demonstrates long-horizon, stateful execution
- `"What do you know about PLN? How confident are you in that?"` — surfaces the reasoning and uncertainty tracking layer
- `"Remember that I started working on the code now, and remind me when ten minutes have passed."` — tests memory and timer functions

> The capability of the agent is directly proportional to the power of the LLM it is harnessed to. Experimenting with different models is encouraged!

**5. Stop OmegaClaw when done:**

```shell
docker stop omegaclaw
```

Do not leave your IRC channel unattended. For protection and token usage, stop the container when not actively using OmegaClaw.

**6. Restart your container:**

```shell
docker start omegaclaw
```

**7. Memory persistence:**

OmegaClaw saves memory embeddings — knowledge, skills, interactions, and learning — to your host via Docker. This persists across restarts and reinstalls.

To reinitialize OmegaClaw to a clean-install state:

```shell
docker rm -f omegaclaw
docker volume rm omegaclaw-memory
```

Then return to step 1.

### Helpful Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docker logs -f omegaclaw` | Runtime container inspection |
| `docker logs -f omegaclaw \| grep -v '^(CHARS_SENT'` | More granular log inspection |
| `docker ps` | List running containers |

---

## Using Skills

OmegaClaw comes with a set of built-in skills for actions and more accurate responses. This includes integration with Agentverse agents such as the Tavily Search Agent and Technical Analysis Agent for specialized tasks.

All built-in skills are available by default once the agent is running. OmegaClaw decides when to use them based on context, though you can explicitly instruct it:

```
"Summarize the latest news about the ASI Alliance using Tavily Search"
```

You can monitor which skills the agent is using, as well as its reasoning process, by checking the Docker container logs.

## Implementing OmegaClaw Skills with Agentverse Agents

To implement minimal skills for OmegaClaw using Agentverse agents, follow these three steps.

### 1. Implement an Agentverse Module

Using the [uAgents framework](https://pypi.org/project/uagents/) by FetchAI, create a Python module that handles interaction with a target Agentverse agent. At minimum, the module should expose a simple function that calls the agent with all required input parameters.

Example implementation:

```python
def tavily_search(search_query: str, timeout: int = 60) -> str:
    try:
        request = WebSearchRequest(query=search_query)
        response = asyncio.run(
            _ask_agent(TAVILY_SEARCH_AGENT_ADDRESS, request, int(timeout))
        )
        return _format_tavily_results(response)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"error: {e}"
```

### 2. Implement a MeTTa Call Function

To enable skill invocation, define a function in MeTTa that calls your Python module. In the `src/skills.metta` file, implement a function that accepts the required arguments and forwards them to the Python module responsible for calling the Agentverse agent.

Example implementation:

```metta
(= (tavily-search $query)
   (py-call (agentverse.tavily_search $query)))
```

### 3. Register the Skill in OmegaClaw

In the same `src/skills.metta` file, update the `getSkills` function by adding a new entry that defines:

- The purpose of the skill within OmegaClaw
- The corresponding function that invokes your Agentverse agent

Skills are grouped into categories — choose the most appropriate one based on the agent's functionality and intended use.

Example registration:

```metta
(= (getSkills)
   (;INTERNAL:
    ...
    ;SHELL AND FILE I/O:
    ...
    ;COMMUNICATION CHANNELS:
    ...
    "- Search the web using the Tavily Search Agent: (tavily-search string_in_quotes)"
    ...
```

---

## Option 2: Intermediate Install

*For more control over image creation and functions.*

```shell
git clone https://github.com/trueagi-io/PeTTa
cd PeTTa
mkdir -p repos
git clone https://github.com/asi-alliance/OmegaClaw-Core.git repos/OmegaClaw-Core
cd repos/OmegaClaw-Core
git fetch origin hackathon-2604
git checkout hackathon-2604
```

Make any desired changes, then build your own Docker image:

```shell
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```

Run with the startup script and continue from Option 1, step 3:

```shell
./scripts/omegaclaw <your-image-name>
```

---

## Option 3: Expert Install

*Most flexible and modular option. Best suited for advanced users or when Docker is not available.*

cd repos/OmegaClaw-Core
git fetch origin hackathon-2604
git checkout hackathon-2604
cd ../..
cp repos/OmegaClaw-Core/run.metta ./
```

**3. Set up Python virtual environment:**

```shell
python3 -m venv ./.venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

**4. Install Python dependencies:**

CPU only (or no GPU embeddings):
```shell
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
python3 -m pip install -r ./repos/OmegaClaw-Core/requirements.txt
```

With GPU:
```shell
python3 -m pip install -r ./repos/OmegaClaw-Core/requirements.txt
```

## Reference — Configuration Options

Defaults are recommended for smooth operation. To customize, add parameters inside the startup script after `IRC_channel="$IRC_channel"`. Don't forget to add a continuation backslash `\`.

> The startup script is located at `scripts/omegaclaw`.

```metta
(= (configure $name $default)
(let $value (argk $name $default)
(add-atom &self (= ($name) $value))))
```
